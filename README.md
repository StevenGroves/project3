Graphing visualization completed with the aid of the Bokeh Python library. 
The user's chosen Youtube channels total likes, dislikes, subscribers,
and views are summed up and shown through a graphical bar chart. The user
is also able to further inspect the bar chart with the added pan, box zoom,
wheel zoom, resize, and hover tools. Those functions may be chosen by clicking
on the preferred function icon on the toolbar above the chart. The hover 
functions allows the user to hover the cursor over a bar and see the information
associated with that bar, specifically the channel, the feature that it is 
representing, and the total number of that specific feature (i.e. likes, dislikes...).
